# Fantasy WAR
Creates fantasy WAR for any season from 2018 to 2021, using projected points as a stand in for start percentage in ESPN leagues. Uses data scraped from the ESPN api and data from the nflfastR database to calculate WAR.  Thank you to cooperdff for creating an easy way to retrieve nflfastR data in python, Jeff Henderson for his WAR article at fantasypoints.com for the basis of the WAR methodology, and finally cwendt94 and Steven Morse for their work making the ESPN api more accessible.
